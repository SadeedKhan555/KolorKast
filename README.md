# KolorKast
KolorKast is a color detection Android app created for color blind people. The user takes a photo of an object and drags their finger across the screen to the desired area of the photo. KolorKast determines the RGB values, Hex Value, Hue Value, and the name of the color and displays this information on the screen.
